text.rules.title.one = Game Preparation
text.rules.preparing.for.game = Divide into two teams, come up with your team names, choose a color for your team, and set the suggested number of rounds and round time. The application will randomly determine which team goes first. The team selects the Artist ? the player who will draw first.
text.rules.title.two = Let's Start the Game!
text.rules.start.game = The Artist takes a card from the deck and looks at the words they need to draw without showing them to other players. You receive only one card per turn and cannot use another card, even if all the words have been guessed.\n\nBefore starting to draw, make sure the tip of the pen is facing the camera of the device. Press and hold the button on the Pictionary Air pen to draw. Release the button when you finish drawing. You can press and release the button as many times as needed to create the image. You can draw symbols (including the $ symbol) and arrows but cannot draw numbers or letters. Sound is not allowed.\n\nPress the "+1 point" button to add a point when players from your team guess the drawn word correctly.\n\nTo erase the drawn image, press the "Clear" button.\n\nWhen the time is up, the next team starts drawing and guessing. The game continues with team rotations and Artists.
text.rules.title.three = Drawing Rules
text.rules.drawing.rules = YOU CAN...\n1) Use symbols and arrows.\n2) Interact with the image you drew.\n3) Draw any object related to the word, regardless of its relevance to the word's meaning.\n4) Break words into syllables.\n\nYOU CANNOT...\n1) Use letters or numbers.\n2) Use dashes to indicate the number of letters in a word.\n3) Use sounds.\n4) Use gestures.\n\n\nPRECISION OF THE CORRECT ANSWER\nThe accuracy requirements for the correct answer are determined by the teams before the start of the game. For example, will the answer "pitcher" be accepted instead of "flowerpot"? Will "enlargement" be accepted instead of "enlarge"?
